       sooo. baked alaska. yeah. baked alaska is basically sponge cake with ice cream on top, covered in meringue. then you bake it, with the ice-cream still there. "whaaaat, how do you do that belhebleh" - you, well i mean, you dont do anything just bake it, it doesnt melt because meringue and spongecake conduct heat very poorly. was hoping for something cooler? nope, anyway thats it bye :D
