      "I think therefore i am" - albert einstein, unless you're my brother, i dont think he thinks very well. anyway why am i making this? honestly its just filler. for the blog um, the last blog at the end of the row, needs to have a title and description a certain amount of letters, i really cant be bother to fix it, i dont even know the basics of javascript yet, so just remember sometimes the last blogpost in the row is going to be stupid and random, its just going to be the first thing that pops into my head. and for those of you who cant think well like my brother the last blogpost will be named "filler" :D
