    <h3 class="body">so.. this is the first blog, honestly i dont know why i even have a blog, i dont need one. I'm not sure what to write or whether or not i should use proper grammer. i probably should, but im not going to. anyway I think 
      i know what i should write about, I'm going to write about a movie called officespace, no, i should write about arcane, nothing can top arcane. apparently arcane is my new "brief obsession" but i mean arcane was so awesome,
      i'll never get bored of it, im sure of it, this show wasn't like the darkest minds, assassination classroom, titans, the umbrella academy, fate the winx saga, the vampire diaries, bridgerton, raising dion, carmen sandiego, project mc2, the chilling adventures of sabrina, she-ra, merlin, lost song, girl from nowhere, lost in space, sixth sense, an unfortunate series of events, anne with an e or sweet tooth,(you should watch those shows too :3) nothing can top arcane. oh and the song, enemy by imagine dragons is the THEME SONG, WHAT CAN TOP THAT. if you're wondering what arcane is, welll, its only the greatest netflix tv show in all of film and movie history. the storyline the artstyle the voice acting, i mean Hailee Steinfeld is Vi's voice.
      nothing can top arcane. if you haven't watched arcane you don't deserve that kidney, use it to buy a netflix subscription, i dont care what you're doing, if you don't have a netflix account, steal one, i dont care, just watch arcane. ANNND if you're still not convinced here's picture of arcane.

    <h3 class="body"> obviously my favorite character is jinx, even though shes gone mad, and is mentally unstable, shes just cool. her part of the story is sad, but i won't spoil it for you anyway go watch it or ill steal your netflix account and you won't be able to watch
      anything at all >:(
