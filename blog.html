    <h3 class="body">so.. this is the first blog, honestly i dont know why i even have a blog, i dont need one. I'm not sure what to write or whether or not i should use proper grammer. i probably should, but im not going to. anyway I think 
      i know what i should write about, I'm going to write about a movie called officespace, no, i should write about arcane, nothing can top arcane. apparently arcane is my new "brief obsession" but i mean arcane was so awesome,
      i'll never get bored of it. nothing can top arcane. if you're wondering what arcane is, welll, its only the greatest netflix tv show in all of film and movie history. the storyline the artstyle the voice acting, i mean Hailee Steinfeld is Vi's voice.
      nothing can top arcane. if you haven't seen arcane, you neeeeed to watch it right now, i dont care what you're doing, if you don't have a netflix account, steal one, i dont care, just watch arcane.
