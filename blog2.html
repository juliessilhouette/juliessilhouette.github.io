   wooowww, your actually going to ask this. I'm just kidding, souffles are notoriously difficult, not the recipe, but getting it right.  ok i don't know what you're doing wrong either, how would i know, i dont watch you cook. but, i have tips i guess, get out your notebooks lettuce begin.
   1. let me guess, you put the souffle in the oven AND forgot to preheat it, not only THAT you KEEP CHECKING IT BY OPENING the oven door. stop. just dont do that idiot. ahem, sorry about that (sorry not sorry) i have a cold and im dying of suffication so im verry grumpy, SO JUST deal with it :D 
   anyway i forgot what i was doing, no wait i remember now, its too late though anyway thats it byeee >:D make your own souffles haha. oh and try making the egg white stiff peaks, more stiff.
