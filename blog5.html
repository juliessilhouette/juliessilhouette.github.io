       let me guess why your here, your brother wont stop trying to make your learn javascript. well, heres an idea, why dont you scam him, i mean.. he always makes you make bad trades, he probably once sold a cardboard box to you for 5 dollars. (it was a really nice box) well all that scamming will end, once you scam him back ! so if your brother asks you to learn javascript, tell him you'll learn the basics only if he then codes your entire website for you, not only will you learn javascript, but you dont even have to use it. :D
