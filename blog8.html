        her footsteps echoed the halls as she ran toward a very small looking door, she kept turning her head back to check behind her, each time she grew more and more frantic, as shes trying to unlock the purple padlock hanging across the door handles. In the distance she could hear a hissing sound growing louder. she snaps the lock off the handle and climbs through the door, she takes one look behind her to see a mist of purple, she takes a deep breath and hurriedly slams the door shut. its cramped and dark, she looks down and sees the purple mist seeping through the gaps of the door. Its starts to get quiet, after a while she could hear footsteps outside the door she covers her mouth with her hand and looks through the gaps of the door, she could see someone walking around the hallway, he was wearing a black and white suit with a mask, holding a briefcase in his hand, he lowers himself and closely examines the door, he looks through the gaps, as a grin forms on his face, he places the brief case near the door, and takes a step back.
        
        The briefcase opens and inside is a centipede-like creature with no face but a huge mouth filled with layers of teeth. The creature climbs onto the door handle and opens its mouth, inside the small room she could see the purple mist start to thicken.
        
        her eyes start to blur as she falls back against the wall, through the gap of the door she could see the strange man pick up the empty briefcase and walk away.
        
        suddenly a flash of light passed through the gaps of the door, revealing a vent above her.
        She takes a look through the gaps of the door, with no one to be seen, she then frantically shakes the vent covers in hopes of getting them loose. “Hopeless” she whispers to herself. She jolted her head up as someone says “look to the left” they chuckle. She twisted her head to see a metal rod across the side of the wall, she swiftly picks it up and pries at the vent cover. She slowly picks her self up and looks in the vents, its a long tunnel of metal, it seemed to go on forever. she turns back to the small door, doubting whether or not to climb through the vents. she kneels down and grabs the door handle trying to open it. she places her face near the gaps to see the centipede creature curled up on the door handle. she lets out a sign and twists her head toward the neverending tunnel. "almost there" someone chuckles as she crawls aross the tunnels. in the distances is a wirring noise, she rushes toward the noise to find a fan, the second she gets there she froze. behind the fan, was an alley way. she swiftly jams the metal rod in the fan, stopping it. she climbs through and jumps onto a dumpster, turning her head she could see she finally left the building, her memory starts to fog up as she trys to remember what she was doing in that buildng. why was she there and who was that voice, she wonders, she doesn't even remember what happened that morning or the morning before.
